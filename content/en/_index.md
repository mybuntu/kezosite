Hi! I'm Jules, and this is where I'll share most of my IT knowledge, labs, CTF writeups and maybe some other stuff. For now this will serve as a plateform to promote myself and show you that if you ever have IT related questions I might be the one to give you some IT related answers ! 
So feast your eyes dear stranger person, for this is the most interesting website you'll ever find on the internet !
